                    <h5 class="subTitle">Background</h5>
                    <p>
                        Heading into this research project, we had a hypothesis many that many plant-loving Torontonians faced an issue.
                        An issue accounting for the lack of space within the city, for plant-lovers to thrive. 
                        Our hypothesis began assuming Toronto's lack of space meant many plant-owners faceed issues with not having 
                        sufficient space to plant their gardens. 
                    </p>
                    <h5 class="subTitle">Problem Statement</h5>
                    <p>
                        After conducting survey and user interviews, we were able to conclude our issue we assumed many Torontonians faced, was false.
                        In actuality, the data suggested people with plants have difficulty locating information on plant identification and instruction and are overwhelmed, lost, thus 
                        killing their plants.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        How might we design a platform that can be an 
all in one source of information for guidance, caring, and advice from other peers to help any plant owner care for their plants?

                        Initially, we aimed to connect plant owners for cutting and plant trading, but our users had other pressing needs. 

                        Our research unveiled an unmet demand for reliable and localized plant care guidance.
